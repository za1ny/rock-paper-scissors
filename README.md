Rock paper scissors game where you play against the computer.

This is my first game that incorporates HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
It was initially a tough learning curve, one that I am still on and I would like to return
back to this game and fine tune the JS code in the future as I know that is something to improve upon.

Learning JS was fun and seeing the final product further encourages me to learn more in this space!
